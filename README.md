# House Price Prediction

## Project Overview
The House Price Prediction project aims to build predictive models to estimate house prices based on various features using machine learning techniques. 
The project utilizes several regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and XGBoost Regression, to analyze and predict housing prices from the provided dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is included in the repository. It contains various attributes related to houses that can influence their prices, such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and more.

## Libraries Used
This project uses the following Python libraries:
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms
- `xgboost` for enhanced regression performance
## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the models is evaluated using the following metrics:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
- R-squared Score
## Installation
To run this project, you will need to have the following libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

## Conclusion
This project serves as an introduction to machine learning model development and evaluation for house price prediction. 
Further enhancements can include hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and exploring additional models.
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
